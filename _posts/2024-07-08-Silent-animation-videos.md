Ég og Bjarki bróðir minn útbjuggum hljóðlaus myndbönd til notkunar í eðlisfræðikennslu. Verkefnið hlaut styrk úr Þróunarsjóði námsgagna (*ÞNS 2023 232672 1601*). Hugmyndin er í hnotskurn sú að nemendur taki upp eigin talsetningu yfir myndböndin, til dæmis með því að nota *Voice Memos* á iPhone eða *Voice Recorder* á Android.

Myndböndin eru hugsuð sem verkfæri fyrir virka þátttöku nemenda, þar sem þeir fá tækifæri til að túlka og útskýra eðlisfræðileg fyrirbæri með eigin orðum.

Grein sem lýsir verkefninu í heild sinni var birt í *Physics Education* hjá IOP Publishing:

- Preprint: [silent-animation-videos.pdf](/assets/files/silent-animation-videos.pdf)
- Published version: [10.1088/1361-6552/adaf6a](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6552/adaf6a)

## Myndbönd

### 1. Projectile Motion

A ball is thrown in projectile motion towards a basket. Graphs of the position, velocity and acceleration are shown during the ball's motion.

### 2. Inclined Plane

A block slides down an inclined plane with friction. The vector decomposition of the forces acting on the block are shown. Included is a derivation of the minimum angle of inclination such that the block slides down.

### 3. Centripetal Acceleration

Derivation of centripetal acceleration by drawing velocity and acceleration vectors at successive time intervals. Based on a description by Landau.

### 4. Planetary Motion

Kepler's laws of motion visualized. A planet revolves in an elliptical trajectory around a star. The area law is shown, and a derivation of Kepler's third law for circular orbits is presented.

### 5. Ballistic Pendulum

A ball is ejected from a spring from which it impales a ballistic pendulum. The narrative emphasizes the difference between energy and momentum conservation.

---

### 6. Archimedes' Principle

The buoyant force acting on the block submerged in a liquid is shown in terms of the pressure acting on the top and bottom surfaces. Condition for whether an object floats or sinks is analyzed.

### 7. Simple Harmonic Motion

A mass attached to the end of a spring is shown. The oscillatory motion is analyzed from the displacement graph. The connection with the spring constant and the frequency of the oscillation is shown.

### 8. The Doppler Effect

A source emitting a sound wave is shown in the case that it moves towards a stationary observer. The shortened wavelength and increased frequency as measured by the observer is explained.

---

### 9. The Ideal Gas Law

A box containing particles bouncing on the walls. The gas law in various settings is explained in terms of the pressure, volume, temperature and speed of the particles bouncing inside the box.

### 10. Electric Field Lines

The electric field lines of positively and negatively charged particles are shown by considering the forces acting on a test charge. The field lines of an electric dipole are shown.

### 11. Velocity Selector

A positively charged particle moves inside a parallel plate capacitor in addition to moving in an auxiliary magnetic field perpendicular to the electric field of the capacitor.

---

### 12. Time Dilation

Einstein's classic derivation of time dilation is presented by a train thought experiment. Presented from the perspective of an observer inside the train and outside the train respectively.
